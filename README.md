# Spinor1D
This code is to understand jet emission phenomena I studied during my phD. Pluto notebooks contains most of the codes and theories. /notebook/demo.jl notebook is a good starting point. Following messages are autogenerated by DrWatson.jl. Looks like notebooks crashes if we update the package versions.  Probably Unitful.jl related. Luckly, Pluto notebook tracks the package version.

This code base is using the Julia Language and [DrWatson](https://juliadynamics.github.io/DrWatson.jl/stable/)
to make a reproducible scientific project named
> Spinor1D

It is authored by Kyungtae.

To (locally) reproduce this project, do the following:

0. Download this code base. Notice that raw data are typically not included in the
   git-history and may need to be downloaded independently.
1. Open a Julia console and do:
   ```
   julia> using Pkg
   julia> Pkg.activate("path/to/this/project")
   julia> Pkg.instantiate()
   ```

This will install all necessary packages for you to be able to run the scripts and
everything should work out of the box.
